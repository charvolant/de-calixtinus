## 0.6 - 2025-03-23

### Added

* Rest days and pre-holiday "stock-up" days
  * This is still a work in progress. The system works by building days and then dividing the days into stages.

### Added

* Bondi-Manly walk
* Calendars, regions and locality-based public holidays.

  This violates the spirit of the Camino but lots of people do it
