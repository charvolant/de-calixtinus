FitnessText1: To begin with, choose the way you intend to travel. Then choose the level of fitness that you have.
FitnessText2: Easy mode allows you to fill out a few fields about your travel style and which routes you want to travel. Sensible defaults are then used for things like daily distance, accommodation preferences, must-see stops and the like. Detailed mode allows you to fine-tune your preferences in terms of distance, accommodation, where to stop and so on. However, the level of detail can be quite complex. Use easy mode to start with and then uncheck this box to allow more detail once you are familiar with the system.
FitnessBottom: Be careful with fitness. Normal is normal for a young walker with plenty of training; someone who can walk three hours at 5km/hr without tiring. If you have any doubts, choose Unfit.

HomeText1: Welcome to De Calixtinus.
HomeText2: If you are planning to walk the Camino Santiago, this site allows you to develop a set of daily stages tailored to your level of fitness and preferences in terms of accommodation, food etc. The panner is designed to give you a globally optimal set of stages, stretching some a bit and reducing others, to give you the best overall trip. It does this by minimising "penance" a name that captures the total effort for a day, including distance, climbs and descents, accommodation, sources of food and other things.
