<h2>About De Calixtinus

<p>
  De Calixtinus is a tool for planning a pilgrimage along the Camino Santiago (Way of St James),
  a pilgrimage that that runs from numerous start points to Santiago de Compostella in North-West Spain.
  The tool allows you to express preferences for how far you want to walk each day, the sort of accommodation
  that you would prefer to stay in at the end of the day's travel, whether you will need food or clothes washing
  facilities at the end of the day, whether there is any particular place where you want to stop at so that you
  can go sightseeing at the end of the day and so on.

<p>
  Once you have described your preferences, De Calixtinus will attempt to build you a globally optimised set of
  stages, reflecting those preferences.
  The <em>globally optimised</em> bit is important.
  The tool will stretch some days a bit and squeeze others to ensure that you have the best possible Camino,
  in terms of your preferences, that is possible.
  It is possible that a stage many days in advance will cause a change in a previous day's walking, as the planner
  attempts to improve the entire experience.

<p>
  The idea for De Calixtinus came when the author (Doug) and his partner (Alison) were walking the Portuguese Camino in 2023.
  We'd done our homework and planned things out with the help of guidebooks.
  But I turned 60 on the Camino and Alison is not that far behind.
  We were pretty good at the normal stages of 20-24km but once we hit 28km we were exhausted and by 30km we
  were a very, very sad sight.
  So, while I was walking, I started to think about how to plan an optimal route.

<p>
  I took inspiration, oddly enough, from the <a href="https://www.tug.org/">TeX</a> typography system.
  TeX has an absolutely stellar paragraph layout system that builds justified paragraphs by optimising the
  amount of extra whitespace inserted between words to produce the most aesthetic paragraph possible.
  Breaking a paragraph into lines and splitting a Camino into stages are, computationally speaking, not
  that far apart and it provided a model for how to plan a Camino using a mathematical optimisation technique called
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">dynamic programming</a>.

<p>
  I'd also always wanted to learn the <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> programming language.
  However, learning Haskell is quite the uphill struggle and I needed a self-contained project that would
  motivate me to push myself to learn the new concepts that underlie Haskell.
  It turns out that this was the project I was looking for.

<h2>What's all this about Penance?

<p>
  Penance started as an in-joke while we were walking the Camino.
  It came after a particularly miserable night where we hadn't made it to the next town.
  No problem, we had sleeping mats and sleeping bags, so we proceeded to make camp next to the track we were following.
  First came the mosquitoes.
  The mosquitoes were driven away by the arrival of a thunderstorm that filled our beds with water.
  Once that was over, the mosquitoes came back.
  With nothing better to do, we started walking and trudged into our destination in the wee hours of the morning, with
  everything shut except for the dogs announcing our arrival.
  When we finally managed to get checked in to where we were staying, having been cold, wet and miserable for something
  like twelve hours, our host commented that we'd paid for all our sins in one go.

<p>
  Dynamic programming requires a single measure to optimise and I started thinking of using "penance" as the
  name of the measure that I was optimising.
  Walking on the Camino, you want to minimise the penance you pay.
  (Or maximise, if you're that sort of pilgrim, but I haven't implemented that yet.)

<p>
  The base unit of penance is a kilometre of walking on flat ground at the start of the day.
  As the day and terrain wear on, adjustments are made for things like hill climbing, descents and fitness levels.
  If a day is particularly short or long, an additional amount of discomfort penance is added.
  After that, preferences in terms of the type of accommodation you want at the end of the day are expressed in
  terms of "I would walk an extra <em>x</em> kilometres to get to a better option nearby."
  Similarly, the services you want at day's end (eg a place to eat or lockers for your valuables) are expressed
  in terms of "I would walk an extra <em>y</em> kilometres to get this."
  All of this is added together to get the cost for the entire day, expressed in kilometres-equivalent of walking.

<h2>Why De Calixtinus?

<p>
  Book V of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Calixtinus">Codex Calixtinus</a> is a guide book compiled in the
  12th century, intended as a guide for pilgrims attempting the Camino Santiago.
  <em>De Calixtinus</em> means "of Calixtinus" and seemed like a rather nice way of reflecting that the planner
  is basically yet another guide to the Way.

<p>
  However, I promise that the author of the program doesn't have the same down on the Navareese that the author
  of the codex does.

<h2>Camino Options

<p>
  Currently, there is source data for seven caminos:
  the Camino Portuguese, the one we walked; the Camino Frances; the Camino del Norte; the Camino Ingles;
  the Camino Primitivo; the Camino Invierno (the winter camino); and the Camino Fisterra.
  I've also added in the Bondi-Manly walk, about as far away from the Camino Santiago as you can get, both
  figuratively and physically, for funsies.
  Setting up the data for a Camino route is quite the undertaking, with the Portuguese route weighing in at
  over 9,000 lines of JSON.
  Each release tends to include a new camino, alternating between shortish camino, such as the Camino Ingles and
  a full-cream one, such as the Camino del Norte.

<h2>Source Code

<p>
  This is an open-source project.
  The code is available on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/charvolant/de-calixtinus">here</a> under the
  permissive <a href="https://opensource.org/license/mit">MIT licence</a>.

<h2>Sources of Data

<p>
  The major source is the excellent <cite>Buen Camino</cite> app.
  This app gives most of the information above in a useful form while walking the Camino.
  It also updates dynamically and can be used to load multiple Camino routes.
  You can get more information about this at the Apple Store, Google Play or at the
  <a href="https://www.editorialbuencamino.com/">app website</a>.
  My heartfelt thanks to Editorial Buen Camino, who gave me permission to use their data.

<p>
 A secondary source is <cite>The Camino Portugués</cite> by Kat Davis (Cicerone, 2019), which we
 \ used as a planning book.
 \ Another secondary source is <cite>The Camino del Norte and Camino Primitivo</cite>
 by Dave Whitson and Laura Perazzoli (Cicerone, 2019) for the Camino Primitivo and Camino del Norte.

<p>
  Good-old Google Maps was used to estimate total ascent and descent between
  waypoints and fix suitable waypoint locations.
  The map elevation API was also used to gather elevation data.
  Google Maps was also used to estimate train and bus stations.

  The <a href="https://www.bonditomanly.com/">Bondi to Manly Walk</a> website provides detailed information

  And, of course, we did our own stuff.
