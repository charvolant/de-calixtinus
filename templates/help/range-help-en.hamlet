<h2 #range-help>Distance and Time Preference Ranges

<p>
  Distance and time preferences are expressed as ranges.
  These ranges are used to help calculate the "penance" score for a proposed day's stage and put hard and soft limits on
  how far and how long each day is to be.
  (See the general help for more information on penance.)
  The five values in the range are:

<table .table .table-striped>
  <caption>Range Types
  <thead>
    <tr>
       <th scope="col">Position
       <th scope="col">Description
  <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td .text-danger>Minimum
        <td>The absolute minimum that is acceptable.
            \ A day's stage calculated by the planning system will, generally, be at least this distance or time.
    <tr>
        <td>Lower
        <td>The lower bound of acceptability.
            \ This is the minimum distance or time that you would wish to walk.
    <tr>
        <td .text-success>Target
        <td>The target.
            \ This is the distance or time that you wish to walk each day.
    <tr>
        <td>Upper
        <td>The upper bound of acceptablity.
            \ This is the maximum distance or time that you would wish to walk.
    <tr>
        <td .text-danger>Maximum
        <td>The absolute maximum that is acceptable.
            \ A day's stage calculated by the planning system will, generally, be at most this distance or time.

<p>
  Once the distance/time strays outside the upper or lower bounds, the planner will start adding
  penalties to the day's penance score.
  These penalties will tend to steer the planner away from over-long (or short) days.

<h3 #distance-help>Distance

<p>
  The distance preferences describe how far you want to walk each day.
  This section allows you to specify the "walk about 20km each day" advice that is often given and
  place limits on how far you are willing to stray from that advice.

<p>
  These distances take no account of climbs or descents â€” these get factored into the planning in other ways.
  If you are walking a particularly hilly Camino, have a look at the <em>feels like</em> entry for each day and,
  if they look particularly oppressive, consider lowering the range.

<p>
  The distance range is pre-populated with values derived from the travel type and level of fitness that you have supplied.
  The target is based on how far you can get in roughly five hours of walking

<h3 #time-help>Time

<p>
  The time range is for how many hours you want to walk each day.
  Generally, this will be have a target lower than a full day's walking, allowing for rests, lunch, diversions
  and the business of finding accommodation and getting fed at the end of the day.
  The actual time taken each day will be somewhat longer.

<p>
  The time range is pre-populated with values derived from the travel type and level of fitness that you have supplied.
  The target is five to six hours, depending on fitness levels.

<p>
  It is generally a good idea to leave the minimum and lower bounds at zero and let the distance range control minimums.

<h3 #rest-help>Rest Days

<p>
  The rest range describes how many days you want to walk before taking a break to recover, wash your clothes,
  take care of any medical issues, see the sights and generally indulge in rest and recreation.
  Rests are usually targeted to take place in cities or large towns with plenty of services.

<p>
  The rest range is pre-populated with values derived from the travel type and level of fitness that you have supplied.


<h3 #rest-pressure-help>Rest Pressure

<p>
  "Rest Pressure" pushes the planner towards making stops at locations that are good for a rest-break: plenty of
  services, accommodation options and the like.
  With rest pressure, if there is a likely-looking spot nearby, the planner will tend to extend or contract
  the current day to reach that spot.

<p>
  The rest pressure is defined in terms of how far away the least attractive rest spot needs to be before the planner
  starts considering it as an option.
  The closer you get to the rest point, the more the pressure increases.
  If you do not want the planner to use rest pressure, make this field blank.

<p>
  By default, the rest pressure is pre-populated with values derived from the travel type and levels of
  comfort and fitness that you have supplied.
