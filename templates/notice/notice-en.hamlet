<h3>Cookies

<p>
  De Calixtinus uses cookies for session tracking and to keep a persistent copy of your current travel and route preferences.

<h3>Persistent Data
<p>
  De Calixtinus does not keep any other personal information, or share information with other entities, other than as saved plans.

<p .text-bg-warning>
  De Calixtinus saves generated plans for revisiting and sharing with others.
  These plans are publicly viewable by anyone with the unique link.
  The generated plans contain no personal information or identification

<h3>Usage

<p>
  This is intended to be a helpful tool for people planning their trip.
  It provides a <em>suggested</em> itinerary that you can choose to ignore any time you feel like it.

<p>
  De Calixtinus is (usually) fast enough to allow you to revisit things en-route, starting from where you currently are.
  One of the reasons that it keeps your current set of preferences in a cookie is so that you can breeze through
  things you don't want to change if, for example, you didn't quite make your goal and what to re-plan mid-camino.

<p>
  De Calixtinus doesn't really distinguish between an interesting place
  to stop, full of sights and entertainment, and a boring, dusty waypoint in the middle of nowhere.
  Or a bar that is sometimes open for a couple of hours each day or a full-dress restaurant.
  Or a small corner shop and a full-blown supermarket.

<h4>Units

<p>
  De Calixtinus uses the metric system, both internally and for input and display.
  A possible future enhancement is to allow the user to specify their preferred unit system but,
  right now, metric it is.

<h3>Disclaimer

<p .text-bg-danger>
  De Calixtinus is still under development

<p>
  Just because "Computer Says So!" doesn't mean it's a good idea.
  So use your own judgement and check other sources of information.
  The output from this program is no substitute for either careful planning or
  casual resilience in the face of adversity.

<p>
  I've done my best to be accurate about the data but ...
  if you're relying on something to be true, check with other sources, as well.
  Things change: places to stay come and go, temporarily shut down
  or get filled up; roads get blocked; on Sunday <em>everything</em> shuts down and you need
  to plan accordingly.
